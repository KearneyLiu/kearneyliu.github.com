&lt;p&gt;I wish all people best of luck in 2014, and keep healthy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I would like to get a good application result in this last year of my undergraduate study.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Kearney Liu</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kearneyliu.com,2014-01-31:pages/2014/01/31/happy-chinese-new-year.html</guid><category>2014</category><category>Chinese New Year</category></item><item><title>Deliverable &amp; Readable</title><link>http://www.kearneyliu.com/pages/2013/09/30/deliverable-readable.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I am invloved into a project with full of energy, so I have not updated my blog for one month. However, I achieved many experience about designing and making a software, such as &lt;strong&gt;deliverable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;clean code&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deliverable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so important that we should finish our tasks before the due day when we are working. We should not make any excuse to explain why we do not work it out.Therefore, it's a big question that how I arrange my schdule of the task I have to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of majoring in Natural Language Processing, I am responsible for the part of term extraction and normalization in a business intelligence project. At first, I design how to design a data structure and interface for ten days. But I only have four weeks, and it's such a huge system. Then I start to code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I encountered a problem that the data structure of a variable was false in the last few days. My mentor told me that the deliverable is so significant, do not waste others' time. So I have to stay up to revise my code. Finally, I completed it in the last two days and succeeded submiting it on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I should put the fuction of machine learning into the whole system, and the algorithm is so challenging to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we should make our code readable and clean. The code is not just read by the computer, but, in most of time, the code is read by co-workers. If someone spends too much time reading your code, he will be annoyed about your code and look upon down your coding ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a saying from Bjarne Stroustrup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love elegant and efficient code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also mentions the code needs to be logic and each function must be abstracted. In addition, how to name the function as well as the comments, commit logs are designed to be clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, I experienced the clean code a lot. Elegant code may help us improve the efficiency a lot. So we can save a lot of time of reading others' code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I would make my best to make code cleaner in order to keep a good coding principle.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Kearney Liu</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kearneyliu.com,2013-09-30:pages/2013/09/30/deliverable-readable.html</guid><category>Project</category></item><item><title>Hello, BLOG!</title><link>http://www.kearneyliu.com/pages/2013/08/14/hello-blog.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is my own blog and I will tell what I think to the world!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Kearney Liu</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kearneyliu.com,2013-08-14:pages/2013/08/14/hello-blog.html</guid><category>Hello</category></item></channel></rss>
