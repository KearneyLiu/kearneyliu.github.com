Title: About

Hello, everyone!

I am applying for a master degree now and I will graduate from BUPT in July, 2014. 

With the Pelican technology, this blog is rooted in Github. At here, I will share some of my research interests, life with you.

Love programming in the development environment Mac OS X + Vim + Git. Focus on Shortcuts keys when programming. Enjoy in Github, Quora, Stackoverflow.

To some extent, I am fond of the spirit of geek and love all things full of life.

Meanwhile, I pay much attentions to the news of IT companies, which stimulates my intersts in the area of information technology. I would be absorbed in the Internet business when I graduate from the graduate school.

My CV(Resum√©) is on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/KearneyLiu/7912917) and I will update it in several months.

###**I am a training hard pietist, and also a competition enthusiast.**

I admire & love Kobe Bryant's spirit of insisting and hard working.
