In the undergraduate study, I finished a lot of projects. Some of them are extracurricular, while some of them are course works. Therefore, I gained a lot of coding experience, and project management experience.

###Independent Projects###
**MyFont Designer - Personalized Calligraphy Application Development**

*Spring 2013*

- Developed a calligraphy recognition and reproduction application in Windows for Chinese handwritings.- Designed an improved algorithm for Support Vector Machine to support the recognition and composition of character strokes.- Developed a graphical user interface in C++ with Qt 5.0 framework.
**Student Information Management System**
*December 2012*
- Developed the system with C++ and SQL database to manage students’ information that includes academic status, grades, courses, and advisors.- Designed a user-friendly interface that follows the structure principles of UI design.
**Multimedia Retrieval Platform Research Project**
*September 2012*
- Built the retrieval system framework on Xapian search engine in C++- Used libcurl, a client-side URL transfer library, as a web crawler to collect webpages.- Took advantages of Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical AnalysisSystem(ICTCLAS) to segment Chinese words- Applied probability-based methods for ranking the searching results.- Achieved 95% grades in this project-based course.
###Coursework###
**Link Prediction over arXiv Dataset in “author-paper” Network**

*June 2013*

- Employed Common Neighbors, rooted PageRank and weighted Katz algorithms to predict possible links in a social network.- Applied receiver operating characteristic curve to evaluate above algorithms and discovered that weighted Katz performed better than the others in accuracy in most circumstances- Achieved over 50% accuracy in a “small world” network**Social Network Static Analysis over Friend Relationship Data Crawled from Renren.com**
*April 2013*
- Designed a crawler for Renren.com (Chinese Facebook) to determine and collect users’ relationships with others- Developed the crawler with concurrent programming frameworks in Python and drew relationship graphs with matplotlib package- Analyzed static features of the network, and determined the most influential person on this social network
**Evaluation of Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Hidden Markov Model Algorithms Used in Optical Character Recognition**
*December 2012*
- Applied the above three algorithms to OCR dataset provided by MIT Spoken Language Systems Group- Proposed improvement of weighted-pixel point on HMM, making the precision improved 5%.- On this dataset, KNN Model performs best with 90% precision.
**Webpage Classification with Sequential Minimal Optimization Machine Learning Algorithm**
*October 2012*
- Used Gaussian Kernel (non-linear) to classify webpages into seven categories with the WebKB dataset provided by Carnegie Mellon University.- Combined parts of speech and words location in the webpage as features to train the support vector machines.- Improved 10% precision on the testing results compared with TF-IDF method
**Development of Maze Solving Robot as an Autonomous Car Prototype**
*July 2012*
- Designed an auto direction control system with infrared cameras- Developed timing and alerting system in VHDL on MCS51 microcomputer- Enabled the robot to cross the maze with the shortest time out of 90 teams in a championship
**Simulation of Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output(MIMO) System on Matlab**
*July 2013*
- Applied space-time block code in the Rayleigh fading channel to distribute information- Evaluated the performance of cascade process of STBC-Alamouti and convolution- Simulated the entire system on Matlab, and drew bit error rate graphs to evaluate the properties.
**Implementation of BCH Codes for FPGA in Verilog Hardware Description Language**
*June 2013*
- Encoded BCH codes (31,16) in the system, and allowed the codes to be processed 8 bits per clock cycle- Used minimal hardware resources
